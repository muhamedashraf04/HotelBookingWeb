First Stable Version is a version that contains the required setup for DBContext, Customer Model, appsettings, and once cloned and downloaded packages it should work perfectly after the migrations.
IPMPORTANT : Change the server setting "DefaultConnection" in the app.json file and no one uploads this again!!!
